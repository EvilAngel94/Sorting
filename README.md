# Sorting
[Sorting Web Application](https://sorting-application.web.app/)

Sorting a CSS file inside a block. A simple WebApplication is made with JavaScript, HTML and CSS. 
The blockTitle is ignored and kept in the order as given in the file. The content inside the block is sorted alphabetically. 

Future:
- Adding option to sort titles as well
- Adding option to reverse sorting option (Z-A)
- Adding option to sort the shortest option first in a sub category (e.g. border border-left border-right) (A-Z)
